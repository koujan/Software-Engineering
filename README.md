# Software-Engineering
This project is a part of my Software
Engineering course. It is about Seeded Image Segmentation. The paper that moti-
vated all of this work and the method that is implemented using concepts
learned in the Software Engineering class is Laplacian Coordinates for Seeded Image Segmentation.
