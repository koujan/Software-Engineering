Required Libraries 

---------- OpenCV

---------- Eigen 



The code can be run using Qt (please open the src/common/seededimagesegmentation.pro file in your Qt editor). 
The includepath and libs might need to be changed based on Linux and Mac-OS or Windows platform (comments included in the .pro file).




The code can also be run using cmake. For this we used the cmake-skeleton
provided by Guillaume Lemaitre in 
https://github.com/glemaitre/cmake-skeleton

The code also has one sample unit test. The image is taken from "Grabcut" dataset
